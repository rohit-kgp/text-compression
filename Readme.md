## Text Compression using Huffman Algorithm

• Implemented a lossless data compression Huffman Algorithm using data structures such as trees and priority queue

• Achieved up to 47% text compression while preserving data integrity, employing novel code generation for a sample text file

• Constructed Huffman Tree revealing encoding/decoding specifics and character frequencies derieved from input text

• Designed Huffman Class for tree manipulation, I/O operations, code management, and encoding/decoding using OOPs
